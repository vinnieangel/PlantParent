# PlantParent

Instruction on how to build and run application.

Clone the git repository located here: https://github.com/vinnieangel/PlantParent. Move to the cloned directory and run the command: ‘npm install’ to install the packages necessary for the frontend, and then ‘expo start’ to spin the frontend up. You will be redirected to the expo homepage where you can scan the QR Code through the Expo Go app, and navigate through the application through your own mobile phone, or click `run on IOS simulator` to run the application on a virtual iOS device you have installed on your machine. If you don’t have an iOS mobile device or simulator, you can click ‘Run in web browser’ to run it directly in your web browser, but please note that the web browser does not support some React Native functionalities.

Instructions on how to run tests:
Go to the terminal and type in 'npm run test'. This triggers a script that runs the test through jest.
